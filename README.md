## Background

Welcome to the newsroom! Once again I've accepted a theoretical data visualization position, **until I accept a real one**,  for a major metro paper. I've been tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings.

The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She's counting on me to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through the latest information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

## My Task

### Level 1: D3 Dabbler

Create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty` or `Smokers vs. Age`.

Using the D3 techniques we taught you in class, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. You'll code this graphic in the `app.js` file of your homework directoryâ€”make sure you pull in the data from `data.csv` by using the `d3.csv` function. Your scatter plot should ultimately appear like the image at the top of this section.


### Level 2: Impress the Boss

Why not use this pretend opportunity to sharpen my D3 visualization skills? Afterall it can update graphs on the fly seamlessly
